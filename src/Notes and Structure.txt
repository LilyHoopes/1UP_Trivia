Main is where the group code will all be together.
We will be making temporary branches to add things to the code, and once it works, we merge back to main.
For example, say I make a branch to work on method A, once its working, I push to main.
We will not be doing branches with our names like I thought we would, Lance said the example above is the way to go.
